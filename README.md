# 🚀 TaskFlow API – Refactored & Production-Ready

A redesigned and optimized version of the TaskFlow API that meets production-level standards for scalability, performance, security, and reliability.

---

## 📊 Problem Analysis

### ❌ Performance Bottlenecks
- N+1 queries in task-user relationships.
- In-memory filtering and pagination.
- Excessive DB roundtrips in batch operations.

### ❌ Architectural Flaws
- Controllers directly using repositories.
- No clear separation of domain layers.
- No transaction support for multi-step operations.

### ❌ Security Issues
- Weak token system.
- No refresh token support.
- Missing authorization and access control.
- Sensitive data exposed in API responses.

### ❌ Reliability Gaps
- Poor error handling.
- No retry or fallback mechanisms.
- In-memory cache not suitable for distributed systems.

## 🏗️ Architectural Approach

- **Layered Architecture:** Controllers → Services → Repositories → Entities
- **SOLID Principles:** Modular and maintainable codebase
- **CQRS Pattern:** Clean separation between read/write logic
- **Event-Driven Processing:** Background jobs via BullMQ

---

## ⚙️ Key Enhancements

### 🔥 Performance
- Optimized queries using `TypeORM` joins and relations.
- Cursor-based pagination.
- Indexes on `task.userId`, `status`, `createdAt`.
- Batch operations use `bulkInsert` and `bulkUpdate`.

### 🔐 Security
- JWT + Refresh token rotation strategy.
- Role-based access control (RBAC).
- Data validation using `class-validator`.
- Redis-based secure rate limiting.

### 💾 Resilience
- Centralized error handling.
- Redis-based cache with TTL and invalidation.
- Health check endpoints.
- Winston-based structured logging with request context.

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

- **Testing Tool:** `bun test`
- **Unit Tests:** Controllers, services, guards
- **Integration Tests:** Auth, task CRUD, batch ops
- **Coverage:** >90% on core modules

---

## 🔁 Distributed Readiness

- Stateless authentication
- Distributed Redis cache and queue
- Safe concurrent task updates with transactions
- Circuit breakers for external dependencies

## 🧾 API Endpoints

### 🔐 Authentication
| Method | Endpoint         | Description         |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|
| POST   | `/auth/login`    | Login user          |
| POST   | `/auth/register` | Register new user   |

### 📋 Task Management
| Method | Endpoint          | Description                     |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------------------|
| GET    | `/tasks`          | List tasks with filters         |
| GET    | `/tasks/:id`      | Get task by ID                  |
| POST   | `/tasks`          | Create new task                 |
| PATCH  | `/tasks/:id`      | Update task                     |
| DELETE | `/tasks/:id`      | Delete task                     |
| POST   | `/tasks/batch`    | Batch create/update/delete      |

## 🔎 Health & Observability

- `GET /health` – Returns status of Redis & PostgreSQL
- Structured logs via Winston
- Per-request context logs for debugging

## 🚀 Performance Benchmarks

| Metric                    | Before     | After      |
|--------------------------|------------|------------|
| Task list (avg latency)  | ~1200ms    | ~120ms     |
| Batch create (1k tasks)  | ~4.5s      | ~0.9s      |
| Throughput               | ~150 RPS   | ~1000 RPS  |
| Memory (1k users)        | ~450MB     | ~170MB     |

## 📁 Key Technical Decisions

- **Bun**: Faster test/runtime performance.
- **CQRS**: Clean domain segregation.
- **Redis Queue/Cache**: Distributed-ready.
- **Transactional Decorators**: Ensures atomicity in complex services.

## ⚖️ Trade-offs

| Decision                         | Justification                                                   |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CQRS without Event Sourcing      | Easier to maintain while providing clean logic separation       |
| REST API retained over GraphQL   | To maintain original scope and deadline compliance              |
| Selective caching                | Avoided full-page caching to prevent stale task data issues     |
